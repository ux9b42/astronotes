Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, associated with the element of fire, and is ruled by the planet Mars. This sign spans from approximately March 21 to April 19, marking the start of spring in the northern hemisphere. Aries is symbolized by the **Ram**, which reflects many of its key characteristics such as leadership, assertiveness, and boldness.

### **Origin and Mythology**:
The name "Aries" comes from the Latin word for "ram," which itself traces back to ancient Greek mythology. The ram is a powerful symbol in many cultures, but in Greek mythology, it refers specifically to the **Golden Ram**, associated with the story of **Phrixus** and **Helle**. The ram with golden fleece was sent by the gods to save the twins Phrixus and Helle from being sacrificed. The ram flew them to safety, but Helle fell into the sea, and the area where she landed is now known as the Hellespont. Phrixus eventually reached the land of Colchis, where he sacrificed the ram in gratitude and hung its golden fleece on an oak tree, later forming the basis for the famous tale of **Jason and the Argonauts**.

The ram's association with heroic bravery, action, and strength ties directly to Aries' characteristics. This mythology reflects Aries' desire to face challenges head-on, as well as their natural inclination toward leadership and protection.
